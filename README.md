## credits

The Realms of Tremaria was originally based on CircleMUD 3.0 patch 11. It is 
now being converted from this code base circa 1998 to the more modern tbaMUD
code base, and is currently a work in progress.

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

CircleMUD is available for anonymous FTP at ftp.circlemud.org in pub/CircleMUD.
Its author can be contacted at (jelson@cs.jhu.edu)*.
